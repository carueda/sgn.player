# sgn.player

A basic audio visualizer/player based on [WaveSurfer](https://wavesurfer-js.org)
and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev).
Initial project setup basically by following this [dev.to article](
https://dev.to/johnnymakestuff/how-to-build-a-soundcloud-like-audio-player-app-with-vuejs-quasar-and-wavesurfer-5bic),
(here just intended as a regular webapp --not as a cordova-based mobile version),
and then adding some WaveSurfer plugins.
